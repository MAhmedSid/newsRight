# How to test newsRight app.

1. You will need to create a .env.local file to store your api key with respected name used in code in api fetch url. You can get your api key free from (Newsapi.org).

2. After that run command  `npm i` which will install your all packages.

Thats it now you can use this app , you will need to run `npm start` to run this app.

Your suggestions will be appreciated. And also you can add more functionality in the app by using extra params of the api which will give you feel more like your app.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


Thank you.
